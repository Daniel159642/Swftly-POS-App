Legacy code kept for reference only.

- **document_scraper_legacy.py** – Previous PDF/Excel/CSV table scraper for shipment documents. Replaced by the AI-powered shipment document processor (`shipment_processor.py` + `openai_extractor.py` + `document_processor.py`). The app now uses the new processor when "manual entry" is off in the new shipment flow.
